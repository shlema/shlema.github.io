So, long story short — it's been a great three-year-long ride, but this coming Friday (November 5) is my last day at [Tech.eu](https://tech.eu). It's a bittersweet feeling I'm leaving the company with, and I'm sure the recent [acquisition by Webrazzi][1] will give Tech.eu a huge boost — but this is something I'll be watching from the sideline. 

I joined Tech.eu in 2018 as a news writer, but since then I feel like I've done nearly every possible job within the organisation, except maybe bookkeeping. I've hosted and produced our [podcast show][2], wrote reported features and sponsored content, sent out our newsletters, oversaw a major database migration project, did quite some coding in SQL and Python to leverage our proprietary funding data, represented Tech.eu at conferences online and offline, and did so much more. This was certainly one-of-a-kind opportunity to try a million of different things, and I'm happy I've seized it as well as I could.

For me, Tech.eu has been and will always be about the people, a collection of fun, bright, kind, and curious individuals whom I had a pleasure to encounter over the years. Huge thanks to Natalie, Mary, Helen, Annie, Piyush, Ana, Heini, Natasa, Dan — and, of course, Robin. I've had a great time working with you, I've learned a lot from you all, and I hope to stay in touch in the future. 

As for what happens next, I'm fairly open to opportunities the future may hold. For the time being, I'm happy to take on projects related to podcasting, content strategy, writing, and so on — check out [Proceed.to](https://proceed.to) to see what I, together with a trusted bunch of fellow freelancers, have got to offer. 

If you're reading this post around the time it's published, there's a big chance we'll see each other at Web Summit. Don't hesitate to come and say hi if you see me around, or ping me on [Twitter][3] to meet up!

So, here's to the good old times — and exciting new beginnings.
