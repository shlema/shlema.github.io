**Hey,** 

I’m Andrii Degeler, a podcast producer and tech journalist born in Ukraine and currently living in Amsterdam. Since 2007, I’ve been covering all things technology for online and offline publications across the globe. Most recently, I'd spent over two years at [TNW](https://thenextweb.com), a Finanfial Times company, as the Head of Media. Together with a talented cross-functional media team, we'd built and executed a new editorial strategy focused on the European innovation technology ecosystem.

When I'm not working, I play ultimate frisbee, hoard boardgames, and watch airplanes fly.
